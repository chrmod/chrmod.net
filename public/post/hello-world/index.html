<p>Will try to go fast with this one as it&rsquo;s my first blog post ever.</p>

<h1 id="hello-world:aa77bbfd89a7b0ff10def205b9c08d51">Hello World!</h1>

<p>Guess that&rsquo;s the phrase, that most developers use when they start a new project, right?</p>

<h2 id="yet-another-dev-blog:aa77bbfd89a7b0ff10def205b9c08d51">Yet another dev blog</h2>

<p>Yes, chrmod.net is going to be yet another blog by some kind of developer. You can expect to find here code/configuration snippets, tips for my favorite tools, or solutions to tech problems that I found surprising.</p>

<p>I really wanted to start writing for quite some time now, but you know how it is, beginnings are hard. But finally something has changed.</p>

<h2 id="trigger:aa77bbfd89a7b0ff10def205b9c08d51">Trigger</h2>

<p>It was a very simple thing that I wanted to do (it often starts like that) - to post a picture online, so other people can see how my linux destkop environment looks like atm. Easy you would think, well, sure it is simple for some, not for me.. I&rsquo;ve got an image, a place to post it (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn">unixporn</a> subreddit), and there was only one problem, reddit is not hosting images - it wants an URL.</p>

<p>OK. There are many free image hosting, most people on unixporn use imgur.com, but that would be too easy.
Instead I decided to finally kick off own website in a form of a blog. After 24 hours, here we are.</p>

<h2 id="technology:aa77bbfd89a7b0ff10def205b9c08d51">Technology</h2>

<p>This would not be a tech blog if I wouldn&rsquo;t explain what, how and why I did it.</p>

<h3 id="requirements:aa77bbfd89a7b0ff10def205b9c08d51">Requirements</h3>

<p>First of all, I didn&rsquo;t really want to pay for anything (at least not in the beginning). chrmod.net is suppose to be a blog for sharing stuff, not earning money.</p>

<p>Second, with traditional approach (which I assume is wordpress + mysql + apache, etc), there is so much stuff to care about and to maintain.</p>

<p>Third, I do like to write code and tend to avoid CMSs as much as possible.</p>

<h3 id="solution:aa77bbfd89a7b0ff10def205b9c08d51">Solution</h3>

<p>The obvious way to go was to use some kind of static page generator and host it on github as apparently we&rsquo;re able to use for free for personal stuff (citing chastell on <a href="https://twitter.com/chastell/status/736926755999617024">this one</a>)</p>

<p>Also I really wanted to host my stuff over https. I knew there is letsencrypt, but to use it with github pages didn&rsquo;t look that easy or even possible.</p>

<p>Fortunately I found kludsec that not only provide a free CDN but they also issued SSL certificate from letsencrypt automatically! Amazing!</p>

<p>Summarizing the setup is:</p>

<ul>
<li>hosting: <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a></li>
<li>CDN: <a href="https://kloudsec.com/">kludsec</a></li>
<li>SSL: <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">letsencrypt</a></li>
<li>engine: <a href="http://gohugo.io/">hugo</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Here is that damned screenshot which started all this mess:</p>
